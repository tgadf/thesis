\chapter{Luminosity Calculation}
\label{lumi} 


The probability of n interactions per bunch crossing is ( because a collision is a random process, the distribution will follow Poisson statistics.
\begin{equation}
P = \frac{\mu^{N}}{N!} \times e^{-\mu}
\end{equation}
The probability of at least one bunch crossing is
\begin{equation}
P = 1 -  e^{-\mu}
\end{equation}
The average number of bunch crossings, $\mu$, is defined as
\begin{equation}
\mu = \frac{\mathcal{L} \times \sigma_{\rm{eff}}}{f_{\rm{beam}}}
\end{equation}
Thus, the luminosity can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = - \frac{f_{\rm{beam}}}{\sigma_{\rm{eff}}} \rm{ln}(1-P(n>0))
\end{equation}
By recording the number of bunch crossings without an inelastic collision, the luminosity can be calculated.
