\section{Signal Acceptances}
\label{signal-acceptances}

The signal acceptance is defined as:
$$
\cal{A} = \frac{\cal{B}}{N_{\rm initial}}
\displaystyle \sum_{N_{\rm selected}} \varepsilon_{\rm trigger}
\varepsilon_{\rm corrections} \varepsilon_{\rm TRF}
$$
\noindent where $\cal{B}$ is the branching fraction for the MC
sample, see Table~\ref{mcstats}, $N_{\rm initial}$ is the initial
number of events in each MC sample (also shown in
Table~\ref{mcstats}), $N_{\rm selected}$ is the number of MC events
remaining after selection, and the $\varepsilon$'s are efficiency
correction factors to account for differences between data and MC from
the trigger, particle ID, the $b$-tagging tag-rate functions, and so
forth (see Section~\ref{mc-modeling}).

Table~\ref{acceptances} shows the percentage of each single top quark
signal that remain after selection, and after $b$-tagged jets have
been required. We can compare the acceptances obtained in this
analysis with the published one~\cite{run2-d0-plb}. In that analysis,
we kept 2.6\% of the s-channel events before tagging (with 2--4 jets)
in the electron channel and 2.5\% in the muon channel. In this
analysis, we keep 2.8\% and 2.2\% in the electron and muon channels
respectively (2--4 jets). In the t-channel, in the published analysis
we kept 2.6\% and 2.4\% in the electron and muon channels, and now we
are keeping 2.5\% and 2.0\%. After $b$~tagging, before we kept 1.3\%
of the electron events and 1.3\% of the muon events in the s-channel;
we now keep 1.8\% and 1.4\% respectively. In the t-channel after
$b$~tagging, we kept before 0.9\% in each of the electron and muon
channels. We now keep 1.2\% and 0.9\% of these tagged events.  The
higher acceptances now are from the use of the more efficient neural
network $b$-tagging algorithm, and probably also from the lower
reconstruction threshold for jets.

% The following is commented out until the comparison is updated to
% be for their latest results.
%
%We can also compare these acceptances to those obtained by CDF in
%their most recent analysis. For s-channel and t-channel combined,
%electron and muon channels combined, and events with exactly two jets
%with one or both $b$~tagged, they keep 1.4\% of the expected
%signal. For the same requirements, we also keep 1.4\% of the expected
%signal. In addition we have available to analyze the acceptances in
%the 1, 3, and 4-jets channels, and the untagged 2, 3, and 4-jets
%channels, which CDF have not yet included in their results.
