\section{Event Selection Cuts}
\label{selection-cuts}

We apply a loose event selection to find $W$-like events containing an
isolated lepton, missing transverse energy, and one to four jets with
high transverse momentum. The samples after this selection, which we
call ``pretagged,'' are dominated by $W$+jets events, with some
{\ttbar} contribution which becomes more significant for higher jet
multiplicities. To be able to extract single top events we also look
for the presence of one or two $b$-tagged jets.

Common selection for both electron and muon channels:
\vspace{-0.08in}
\begin{myitemize}
\item Good quality~\cite{dataquality} (for data)
\item Pass trigger: offline electrons and muons in the data are
matched to the object that fired the appropriate trigger for that
run period and triggerlist
\item Good primary vertex: $|z_{\rm PV}| < 60$~cm with at least three
tracks attached
\item Missing transverse energy $15 < {\met} < 200$~GeV
\item One, two, three or four jets with ${\pt} > 15$~GeV and
$|\deta|<3.4$ 
\item The leading jet is required to have ${\pt} > 25$~GeV and
$|\deta| < 2.5$
\item The second leading jet is required to have ${\pt} > 20$~GeV
\item There must be fewer than three noise jets
\item Jet triangle cut $|\Delta\phi({\rm leading~jet,{\met}})|
{\rm ~vs.~}{\met}$: from 1.5 to $\pi$~radians when ${\met} = 0$~GeV,
and {\met} from 0 to 35~GeV when $|\Delta\phi| = \pi$~rad
\end{myitemize}

\vspace{-0.07in}
The electron channel selection: 
\vspace{-0.07in}
\begin{myitemize}
\item Only one tight electron with $E_T > 15$~GeV and
$|\deta| < 1.1$
\item No second loose electron with $E_T > 15$~GeV
\item No tight muon with ${\pt} > 18$~GeV and $|\deta| < 2.0$ 
\item Electron coming from the primary vertex:
$|\Delta z(e,{\rm PV})| < 1$~cm
\item Electron triangle cuts $|\Delta\phi({\rm e,{\met}})|{\rm ~vs.~}
{\met}$:
   \vspace{-0.07in} 
   \begin{myitemize}
   \item from 2 to 0~rad when ${\met} = 0$~GeV, and {\met} from 0
   to 40~GeV when $|\Delta\phi| = 0$~rad
   \item from 1.5 to 0~rad when ${\met} = 0$~GeV, and {\met} from 0
   to 50~GeV when $|\Delta\phi| = 0$~rad
   \item  from 2 to $\pi$~rad when ${\met} = 0$~GeV, and {\met}
   from 0 to 24~GeV when $|\Delta\phi| = \pi$~rad
   \end{myitemize}
\end{myitemize}

\vspace{-0.07in}
The muon channel selection: 
\vspace{-0.07in}
\begin{myitemize}
\item Only one tight muon with ${\pt} > 18$~GeV and $|\deta| < 2.0$ 
\item No tight electron with ${\pt} > 15$~GeV and within $|\deta|
< 2.5$
\item Muon coming from the primary vertex: $|\Delta z(\mu,{\rm PV})|
< 1$~cm
\item Muon triangle cuts $|\Delta\phi(\mu,{\rm {\met}})|{\rm ~vs.~}
{\met}$: 
   \vspace{-0.07in}
   \begin{myitemize}
   \item  from 1.1 to 0~rad when ${\met} = 0$~GeV, and {\met}
   from 0 to 80~GeV when $|\Delta\phi| = 0$~rad
   \item  from 1.5 to 0~rad when ${\met} = 0$~GeV, and {\met}
   from 0 to 50~GeV when $|\Delta\phi| = 0$~rad
   \item from 2.5 to $\pi$~rad when ${\met} = 0$~GeV, and {\met}
   from 0 to 30~GeV when $|\Delta\phi| = \pi$~rad
   \end{myitemize}
\end{myitemize}

\vspace{-0.07in}
Orthogonal samples selection (for measuring the multijet backgrounds):
\vspace{-0.07in}
\begin{myitemize}
\item All the same selection cuts as listed above except for the
tight lepton requirements
\item Electron channel --- only one loose-but-not-tight electron
\item Muon channel --- only one loose-but-not-tight muon
\end{myitemize}
\vspace{-0.07in}
The definitions of loose and tight electrons and muons are given in
Sections~\ref{electron-id} and \ref{muon-id}.

\noindent We also select two cross-check samples, see Appendix~6 for
details.
