\chapter{Results With Data}

\label{results}

The chapter presents the single top quark production cross section measured in nearly 1 fb$^{-1}$ of Tevatron RunII data. The cross section and the observed resolution is presented in Section~\ref{measured}. To measure the expected and observed significance psuedo-datasets with no signal contribution are created and the fraction of datasets with a measured cross section above the observed cross section is calculated. This value is the probability of a background-only fluctuation and can be converted to a Gaussian equivalent signal significance. This result is presented in Section~\ref{significance}.

The combined result with full systematics is
$$
\sigma\left({\ppbar}{\rargap}tb+tqb+X\right)
= 4.6 ^{+1.8}_{-1.5}~{\rm pb}.
$$

\noindent A breakdown of the uncertainties on the $tb$+$tqb$ cross section measurement is given in Table~\ref{tab:syst}. The systematic uncertainties were calculated using an ensemble containing 200 datasets generated with an input single top cross section of 4.6~pb. The cross section of each dataset was measured and the average posterior width (average of upper and lower 1$\sigma$ uncertainties) was calculated over all datasets for each source of systematic uncertainty independently. The systematic uncertainty for each source was estimated by subtracting in quadrature from the average posterior width obtained with a particular source of systematic, the average posterior width without systematic uncertainties. The total expected systematic uncertainty is estimated by adding in quadrature all the individual expected systematic uncertainties.  The statistical uncertainty of the measurement is estimated by subtracting in quadrature the total expected systematic uncertainty from the actual total uncertainty.

\section{Signal Significance and Standard Model Compatibility}
\label{significance}

The measured significance is defined as the fraction ensembles generated with zero input cross section that result in a measured cross section above the observed cross section of 4.6 pb. This quantity, known as the $p$-value, represents the probability that the background alone could fluctuate to mimic the single top quark signal. For the case of Standard Model single top the expected $p$-value is 3.7$\%$, which is equivalent to a 1.8$\sigma$ Gaussian significance of a deviation from a background fluctuation. The measured $p$-value of $0.21\%$ is equivalent to a $2.9\sigma$ significance indicating evidence for single top quark production in the dataset.

\label{pValue}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The probability of a Standard Model signal to have a measured cross section above $4.6$~pb can be estimated using the Standard Model ensemble dataset (i.e. $\sigma_{s+t}=2.9$~pb). Fig.~\ref{probsm} shows the measured cross section for 2,000 Standard Model pseudo-datasets. From this histogram there is a 20.5\% probability that a Standard Model signal could be measured at or above 4.6 pb.
