\@doendnote{endnote17}{``tqb'' is used sometimes when referring to t-channel events because the main diagram that describes these events is the 2$\rightarrow $5 diagram with ``tqb'' in the final state. This analysis uses a 2$\rightarrow $4 diagram with tq as the final state because events with two jets require at most two quarks or gluons in the final state.}
