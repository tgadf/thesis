\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{summary}

We have used leading order matrix elements to separate expected single
top quark signals from background. This analysis used lepton+jets
events selected from nearly 1~fb$^{-1}$ of Run~II~ data. The
two-dimensional discriminant output from the analysis is used to
measure the single top cross section. We obtain the following result:
$$
\sigma\left({\ppbar}{\rargap}tb+tqb+X\right)
= 4.6^{+1.8}_{-1.5}~{\rm pb}
$$

This result has a p-value of $0.22\%$, corresponding to a $2.9\sigma$
Gaussian equivalent significance, meaning it is highly unlikely to be
an upward fluctuation of the background that has produced this
measured cross section.
