%    This document is contained in a single file ONLY because
%    I wanted to be able to distribute it easily.  A real thesis ought
%    to be contained on many files (e.g., one for each chapter, at least).
%
%    To help you identify the files and sections in this large file
%    I use the string '==========' to identify new files.
%
%    To help you ignore the unusual things I do with this sample document
%    I try to use the notation

\abstract{We present the first evidence for electroweak single top quark production using nearly $1$~fb$^{-1}$ of Tevatron Run II data at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$~TeV. We select
single-top-like data events in the lepton+jets decay channel and separate them from backgrounds using
the matrix element analysis method. This technique uses leading order matrix elements to compute an event probability for both signal and background hypotheses. Using the expected signal acceptance, background, and observed data we measure the single top quark cross section:
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\sigma\left({\ppbar}{\rargap}tb+tqb+X\right) = 4.6 ^{+1.8}_{-1.5}~{\rm pb}\\
\end{array}
$$
The probability for the background to have fluctuated up to give at
least the cross section measured in this analysis is
$0.21\%$, which corresponds to a Gaussian equivalent significance of
$2.9\sigma$.}

\vita{Thomas Gadfort was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1979. He graduated
from Oak Ridge High School in Oak Ridge, Tennessee in 1997. At The University of Tennessee he earned a B.A. in College Scholars with an emphasis in Physics and Mathematics in 2001. After receiving a M.S. in Physics from the University of Washington in 2003, he
moved to Chicago, IL, to perform research at Fermilab. He has
graduated with a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of
Washington in 2007, and looks forward to continuing research in
High--Energy Physics.}
