\chapter{Ensemble Generation Technique}
\label{ensemblegeneration}

We can generate multiple pseudo-datasets containing only background
events and run them through the analysis exactly as if they were the
real data events, and obtain a cross section from each one of
them. The p-value can then be calculated as the number of these
ensembles that yield a result equal to the observed or higher, divided
by the total number of ensembles.

To generate these ensembles, we use background events from our model
and treat the fluctuations of each background source separately. We
draw random events from each background source separately, as
indicated by the allowed variation due to systematic and statistical
uncertainties. The event weights are taken into account such that
events with a higher weight will be more likely to be picked. The
variance of the background events is large: we start from 1.34M
electron events and 1.28M muon events, then only consider the two
thirds of these that have not been used in the discriminant
training. The nominal background yields are 755 electron events and
643 muon events. Thus, each ensemble is generated picking around 700
events from around 850,000. The source of background most affected by
oversampling is multijets, since some channels contain very few events
that will be picked repeatedly. Given that the multijet background is
very small and the statistical errors dominate, this does not
introduce a large bias.

The ensemble generation includes a flat (i.e., normalization only, not
shape changing) 20\% error for the {\ttbar} yield ($N_{\ttbar}$),
which represents approximately the overall yield uncertainty from all
systematic effects combined (see Appendix~6). The shift in the
{\ttbar} yield:
$$
N_{\ttbar}^{\prime}
= N_{\ttbar}\times {\rm Gaussian}({\rm mean=1},{\rm width=0.2})
$$
is the same for electrons and muons. The treatment of the $W$+jets and
multijet backgrounds accounts for the normalization to data from the
matrix method and for the effect of $b$-tagging. The error from the
matrix method normalization of $W$+jets and multijet events is
incorporated in the ensemble generation by letting each sample
(multijets, $Wc\bar{c}$, $Wb\bar{b}$ and $Wjj$) fluctuate with a
different random number $r$ sampled from a Gaussian distribution:
\begin{eqnarray*}
r_{\rm QCD} = {\rm Gaussian}(1,0.2) \\
r_{Wjj}     = {\rm Gaussian}(1,0.2) \\
r_{Wbb}     = {\rm Gaussian}(1,0.2) \\
r_{Wcc}     = {\rm Gaussian}(1,0.2) 
\end{eqnarray*}

The background sum of $W$+jets and multijets yields $N_{\rm WQCD}$ is
fluctuated to become $N_{\rm WQCD}^{\prime}$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
N_{\rm WQCD}          &=& N_{\rm QCD} + N_{Wjj} + N_{Wbb} + N_{Wcc} \\
N_{\rm WQCD}^{\prime} &=& r_{\rm QCD}\times N_{\rm QCD}
                        + r_{Wjj}    \times N_{Wjj}
                        + r_{Wbb}    \times N_{Wbb}
                        + r_{Wcc}    \times N_{Wcc}
\end{eqnarray*}
These two expressions fix the normalization to data. What is changed
here is the composition of each of the subcomponents. Once the
correlation between multijets and $W$+jets is taken care of, we also
need to take into account the effect of $b$-tagging. We split the
summed samples of $W$+jets and multijets into 1-tag and 2-tags
sets. The average uncertainty on these samples is 5\% and 12\%
respectively (see Appendix~6), so we form a scale factor $S^{\rm
tag}_{\rm WQCD}$ that incorporates the different rates for tagging
single- and double-tagged events in these samples:
\begin{eqnarray*}
r_{\rm 1tag} &=& {\rm Gaussian}(1,0.05) \\
r_{\rm 2tag} &=& {\rm Gaussian}(1,0.12) \\
S^{\rm tag}_{\rm WQCD}
             &=& \frac{r_{\rm 1tag} \times N^{\rm 1tag}_{\rm WQCD}
                    +  r_{\rm 2tag} \times N^{\rm 2tag}_{\rm WQCD}}
                {N^{\rm 1tag}_{\rm WQCD} + N^{\rm 2tag}_{\rm WQCD}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Finally, the multijets and $W$+jets event yields are fluctuated to:
$$
N_{i}^{\prime} = r_{i} \times \frac{N_{\rm WQCD}}
                                   {N_{\rm WQCD}^{\prime}}
                       \times S_{\rm tag}^{\rm WQCD}
                       \times N_{i} ~;~ i = {\rm QCD}, Wjj, Wbb, Wcc
$$

Once each background source has been fluctuated, we randomly pick
events based on a Poisson distribution of the new systematics-shifted
total background sum:
$$
N_{\rm Data}^{\prime} = N_{\rm QCD}^{\prime}
                      + N_{Wjj}^{\prime}
                      + N_{Wbb}^{\prime}
                      + N_{Wcc}^{\prime}
                      + N_{\ttbar}^{\prime}
$$
