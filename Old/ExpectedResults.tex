\chapter{Expected Results and Cross Checks}
\label{expectedresults}

This chapter presents the expected sensitivity for the single top quark cross section measurement as well as the result of a cross check sample in which the signal region is removed. The expected results and sensitivity are presented in Section~\ref{exp-performance}. Also presented in this chapter are the results from a cross-check sample where the expected single top quark signal is negligible. These results are presented in Section~\ref{data-MC}.
